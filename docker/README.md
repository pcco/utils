# docker

The general convention is each sub directory contains dockerfiles for the specific image.
The `Build Command Example` assumes the current working directory is in the `Directory` specified
in that column.

| Directory                           | Build Command Example                                                         | Purpose                                                              |

| [centos7-builder](#centos7-builder) | <pre><code lang="shell">docker build -t centos7-builder:latest .</code></pre> | Build container to transfer executables to hostigator wordpress host |

## centos7-builder

The wordpress host on hostigator is a centos7 based machine. This image is used to replicate that as a build environment.

Once the image is built, you can create a running container with this command:

```
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/work centos7-builder:latest bash
```

We mount your current working folder path inside `/work` so that any output generated by the container will be available on the host.
Use `curl`, `wget`, or `git` to obtain the source you want to compile. Follow the instructions of those sources to build.
Keep in mind that the container runs as `root`, so any file generated will also be owned as root on your host.

Once you have generated the output, you can scp it over to the wordpress host.
